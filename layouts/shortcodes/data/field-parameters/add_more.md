## add_more (repeater)

Piklist allows you to turn ANY field, or group of fields, into a repeater field, by simple adding the add_more parameter.

**Displaying Data**
To display the results of the Add-More in your theme, pull the data like you normally would. Add moreâ€™s save data as an array, so you can loop though the data to display.

* Input:  boolean
* Default:  false

Example:
`'add_more' => true`
