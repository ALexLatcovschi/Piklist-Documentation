Piklist works well with existing Post Typesâ€¦ those created with the standard WordPress function `register_post_type`. However, you can add some extra power to your Post Types by registering them the Piklist way. Piklist extends the `register_post_type` function with extra parameters to enable extra features.  You can use the standard [`register_post_type()`](https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/register_post_type) parameters, plus the additional Piklist Custom Post Type parameters.

To learn more about registering Post Types with Piklist, please read about the [`piklist_post_types`](/actions-filters/filters/piklist_post_types/) filter.
