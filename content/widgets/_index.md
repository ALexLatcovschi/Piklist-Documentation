### `/parts/widgets/`

With Piklist you can easily create Widgets.

Widgets are made up of two files:

* Output file (This is the only required file)
* Form file (Not required)

## Output file
**This is the only required file for widgets.** Everything in this file will display on the frontend. It can be as simple as standard HTML or a MailChimp form. Or it can be pulled from the Forms File.

The format of this file is: `widget-name.php` (i.e. example.php)

## Form file
This file holds the fields that will be filled in on the Widget page in the WordPress admin.

The format of this file is: `widget-name-form.php` (i.e. example-form.php)
