Adding Piklist meta-boxes, fields, settings pages, Widgets, etc. to your theme is very easy.

* First you need to add the proper [folder structure](/folder-structure) to your theme. Piklist works by searching the active theme for the /piklist folder and then processing the sub-folders and files within it.

* Most Piklist code will go in the folder structure you set up. But other Piklist code, like registering Post Types, would go in your themeâ€™s functions.php file.

## IMPORTANT
You cannot include the Piklist plugin in your theme. It needs to remain a separate plugin.
