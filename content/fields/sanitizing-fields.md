When writing field code, whether with Piklist or not, you should be extra cautious of how you handle data coming into WordPress and how itâ€™s presented to the end user. Piklist makes sanitizing your data easy with the `sanitize` parameter.

Choose the appropriate type of sanitization for each of your fields.
