## Order

The sort order of this group of fields. Allows for creating an absolute order of field groups.
NOTE: If the "lock" attribute is not set, or set to "false", then the order you set is the default.

For meta-boxes, this is within the context and priority.  The user can still drag and drop the meta-boxes and take them out of your designated order.
