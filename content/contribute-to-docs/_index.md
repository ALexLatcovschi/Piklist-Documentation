The Piklist Documentation like Piklist itself is a community effort. The code for the documentation is hosted on Github and can be edited and added to like any other file via a pull request.

This can be done 100% in the Github.com UI. However, if you like you can also pull the repository to your local and edit there.  This guide reviews using the Github.com UI.

## Getting Started
**You only need to do these steps once.**

#### Github.com account
The first step is to make sure you have a Github.com account and you're logged in.

#### Fork the piklist-documentation repository
You need to fork the documentation project so you can have a copy in your own repository. [Visit the documentation repository](https://github.com/piklist/piklist-documentation/) and click on the "Fork" button in the upper right.

Github just copied all the documentation files to your personal Github account.


## Editing an existing page
* At the bottom of every page in the documentation (including this one) is a red "Improve this page" button. Clicking that button brings you to the appropriate page on Github, in YOUR account where you can start editing.
* Make any changes you want. Scroll down to the bottom of the page, add some comments if necessary and click "propose file change".
* Github saves the file and creates a new branch automatically.
* Click "Create pull request".
* Double check your comments and click "Create pull request" again.

## Add a new page

* Go to the [content directory](https://github.com/piklist/Piklist-Documentation/tree/master/content) of the documentation on Github.
* Find the appropriate folder for your new page.
* Click "Create new file"
* Name your file. The name of your file will be the URL for that page so please name it something relevant and SEO friendly. The documenation is written in Markdown, so the file should end in ".md". Example: `how-to-do-awesome-things-with-piklist.md.`
* Add content to the new file. Use an existing documentation file as a guide.
* Scroll down to the bottom of the page, add some comments if necessary and click "propose file change".
* Github saves the file and creates a new branch automatically.
* Click "Create pull request".
* Double check your comments and click "Create pull request" again.
