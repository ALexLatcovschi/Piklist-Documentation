### `/parts/shortcodes/`

With Piklist you can easily create Shortcodes.

Shortcodes are made up of two files:
* Form file
* Output file

## Form file
Everything in this file will display a form in the admin. Piklist automatically creates a form for every shortcode you create with it.

The format of this file is: `widgetname-form.php` (i.e. example-form.php)

## Output file
Everything in this file will display on the frontend. It can be as simple as standard HTML or a MailChimp form. Or it can be pulled from the Forms File.

The format of this file is: `widgetname.php` (i.e. example.php)
